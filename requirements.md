
Requirements

Note :A more detailed version of the following document is included in the CA3requirements.pdf

Requirements outlined in the brief:

An application is required which allows for a user generated playlist to be submitted into a database.

The users names will not be revealed so a login must be created for online submission. 

Another database for collecting descriptions of the playlists must also be included.

The songs submitted in the playlist must be able to store the following details: song name, artist name and year published. A link to where the song can be played online must also be included.










Functions of the program: 

Picture included in CA3requirements.pdf

Above is a basic diagram of the functions of the App. Log4j will store any logs taken by the app. SQLite will store the playlists, music and users. 











Three Additional Functions:

A rating system could be introduced to see which playlists proved to be the most popular. 

A user could share a playlist with themselves or others. Possibly be downloading or forwarding a copy of the playlist.

If the database was expanded the users could submit playlists or songs on a daily basis while keeping a diary about their day and why they chose that song.
